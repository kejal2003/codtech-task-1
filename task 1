## OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT

## PROJECT:SMART HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM

## Objective:
Develop a basic IoT-based smart home system that allows users to control home appliances (e.g., lights, fans, thermostats) remotely using a mobile app or web interface. This project leverages popular IoT development platforms and hardware, such as Arduino, ESP8266, and Blynk, to create an accessible and scalable smart home solution.

### Key Activities
**Define Objectives:** Determine the goals and scope of the smart home system (e.g., controlling lighting, climate, security).







**Identify Key Features:** List the features and functionalities needed, such as remote control, scheduling, automation rules, and integration with other smart devices.





**Budget and Timeline:** Establish a budget and timeline for the project, including hardware, software, and development costs.
